### Useful Links
[Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was super helpful to understand how to layout my page. 

## Challenges To Work On / Future Updates to this Page
- Make the images entirely clickable rather than having only a link in  the top left corner
- Insert the images into the flow of the page rather than as background-images so I can insert images with meaning and add alt text. 
- Working on webpages starting from the mobile perspective and working up instead of the other way around
